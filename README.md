I'm a motivated software development student from Columbus State Community College with a 4.0 GPA,
6 months of professional training, industry certifications, and projects utilizing relevant program-
ming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools. NSF S-STEM IST Scholarship award winner. Look-
ing to use proven programming skills and technical aptitude to meet business needs.

I'm interested in data, AI learning, and building useful things. 

Outside of technology, I have a love for athletics and spend a lot of time training for track and field. I can run 23 MPH, bench 345, and two-hand dunk at 5'10, 190 pounds.
