I'm a motivated software development student from Columbus State Community College with a 4.0 GPA,
6 months of professional training, industry certifications, and projects utilizing relevant programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools. NSF S-STEM IST Scholarship award winner. Looking to use proven programming skills and technical aptitude to meet business needs.

I'm interested in data, AI learning, and building useful things. 

Outside of technology, I have a love for athletics and spend a lot of time training for track and field. I can run 23 MPH, bench 345, and two-hand dunk at 5'10, 190 pounds.
