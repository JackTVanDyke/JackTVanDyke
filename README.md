4.0 GPA student from Columbus State Community College with six months of professional training and industry certifications. NSF S-STEM IST Scholarship Award Winner. 

I'm interested in data, machine learning, and building useful things. Reinforcement learning and solving imperfect information games are really cool. 

Outside of technology, I love competition and athletics and spend a lot of time training for track and field. I aim to be one of the best multi-event athletes in the world. I can run 22.5 MPH, bench 345, and two-hand dunk at 5'10, 190 pounds.
