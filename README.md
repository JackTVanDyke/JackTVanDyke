4.0 GPA student from Columbus State Community College with six months of professional training and industry certifications. NSF S-STEM IST Scholarship Award Winner. 

I'm interested in data, machine learning, and building useful things. Reinforcement learning and solving imperfect information games are really cool. GPU prices are not really cool. 

Outside of technology, I love competition and athletics and spend a lot of time training for track and field. I aim to be one of the best athletes in the world.

Best Speed: 22.5 MPH

Best Vertical: 40 Inches
